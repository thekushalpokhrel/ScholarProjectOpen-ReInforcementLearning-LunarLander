# project-reinforcement-learning-LunarLander

This repository equips you with a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent designed to conquer the challenging Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym. Your mission: to train a model that can skillfully land the lunar lander on the moon's surface, minimizing fuel consumption in the process.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.x
   - TensorFlow 2.x
   - NumPy
   - OpenAI Gym ([https://www.gymlibrary.dev/](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/))

2. **Installation:**

   Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-reinforcement-learning-LunarLander.git
   cd project-reinforcement-learning-LunarLander
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Deep Dive into Deep Q-Learning**

This project delves into DQN, a powerful reinforcement learning technique. Here's a breakdown of the key components you'll encounter:

- **Environment:** The Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym serves as the training ground, simulating the complex maneuvers of a lunar lander spacecraft.
- **Agent:** Your DQN agent, a master in the making, learns to make optimal actions based on its perception of the environment (state observations).
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN):**  This neural network acts as the agent's brain, predicting Q-values (expected future rewards) for each possible action within a given state. (`train_lander.py`)
- **Experience Replay:**  A crucial element for efficient learning. This buffer stores past experiences (states, actions, rewards, and next states), allowing the agent to learn from a diverse set of scenarios, not just the most recent ones. (`train_lander.py`)
- **Evaluation Function (Optional):**  The `eval_func.py` script, while optional, offers a valuable tool. Use it to assess your trained model's performance on unseen scenarios after it's honed its skills.

**Unveiling the Training Process**

Peek inside `train_lander.py` to witness the core DQN algorithm in action. It orchestrates the following:

- **Interaction with the Lunar Lander Environment:** The agent actively engages with the simulated environment, experimenting with actions and learning from the consequences.
- **Experience Collection:** Each interaction generates an experience â€“ a valuable record of the state, the action taken, the reward received, and the resulting next state. These experiences are stored in the experience replay buffer.
- **DQN Model Training:**  Drawing experiences from the buffer, the DQN model undergoes training through experience replay and gradient descent optimization. This process refines the model's ability to predict Q-values, leading to better decision-making by the agent.

**Fine-Tuning Your Reinforcement Learning Journey**

The `train_lander.py` script provides configurable hyperparameters, empowering you to tailor the training process to your needs:

- `gamma`: Discount factor (default: 0.99), influencing the weight given to future rewards compared to immediate ones.
- `epsilon`: Exploration rate (default: 1.0), controlling the balance between random exploration and exploiting existing knowledge.
- `epsilon_min`, `epsilon_decay`: Parameters that govern the exploration rate over time, gradually favoring exploitation as the agent learns.
- `batch_size` (default: 64): The number of experiences used for each training step, impacting the frequency of model updates.
- `learning_rate` (default: 0.001): The step size used during model optimization, determining how much the model's weights change based on the error.
- `target_update_freq` (default: 10): Frequency of updating the target network, a crucial strategy in DQN that helps stabilize learning.

**Customization and Exploration Await**

Feel free to experiment! Explore modifying hyperparameters and network architectures in `train_lander.py` to optimize the agent's performance. Delve into variations of DQN, such as Double DQN or Dueling DQN, to potentially enhance the learning process and fine-tune your model for even more impressive lunar landings.

**Additional Considerations**

- **Visual Training:** The `train_lander.py` script might render the training process visually. If you prefer a faster training experience, adjust the `render_mode` parameter in `env.make()` to disable the visualization.
- **Saving and Loading Your Champion Agent:** Consider implementing functionality within `train_lander.py` to save it.
