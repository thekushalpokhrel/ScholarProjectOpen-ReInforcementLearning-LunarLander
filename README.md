## project-reinforcement-learning-LunarLander

This repository implements a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent for mastering the challenging Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym. The goal is to train a model that can land the lunar lander safely on the moon's surface while minimizing fuel consumption.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.x
   - TensorFlow 2.x
   - NumPy
   - OpenAI Gym ([https://www.gymlibrary.dev/](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/))

2. **Installation:**

   Clone this repository and install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-reinforcement-learning-LunarLander.git
   cd project-reinforcement-learning-LunarLander
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Running the Training:**

   Execute the `train_lander.py` script to start the training process. This script defines the DQN agent and its interaction with the Lunar Lander environment.

   ```bash
   python train_lander.py
   ```

**Project Overview**

This project explores DQN, a powerful reinforcement learning technique. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- **Environment:** The Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym is used, simulating the landing of a lunar lander spacecraft.
- **Agent:** A DQN agent learns to make optimal actions based on the observed state of the environment.
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN):** A neural network model predicts Q-values (expected future rewards) for each possible action in a given state. (`train_lander.py`)
- **Experience Replay:** A buffer stores past experiences to enable the agent to learn from a diverse set of scenarios. (`train_lander.py`)
- **Evaluation Function (Optional):** An optional `eval_func.py` script could be used to evaluate the trained model on unseen scenarios after training.

**Reinforcement Learning Concepts:**

The `train_lander.py` script implements the core DQN algorithm, which involves:

- Interacting with the environment (Lunar Lander)
- Collecting experiences (states, actions, rewards, next states)
- Training the DQN model using experience replay and gradient descent optimization

**Hyperparameters:**

The `train_lander.py` script includes configurable hyperparameters, allowing you to fine-tune the training process:

- `gamma`: Discount factor for future rewards (default: 0.99)
- `epsilon`: Exploration rate for choosing random actions (default: 1.0)
- `epsilon_min`: Minimum exploration rate (default: 0.1)
- `epsilon_decay`: Decay rate for exploration (default: 0.995)
- `batch_size`: Number of experiences used in each training step (default: 64)
- `learning_rate`: Learning rate for the optimizer (default: 0.001)
- `target_update_freq`: Frequency of updating the target network (default: 10)

**Customization:**

Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters and network architectures in `train_lander.py` to improve the agent's performance. You can also explore variations of DQN, such as Double DQN or Dueling DQN, to potentially enhance the learning process.

**Additional Notes:**

- The `train_lander.py` script might render the training process visually. You can modify the `render_mode` parameter in `env.make()` to disable it for faster training.
- Consider saving and loading the trained model (using functionality likely defined in `train_lander.py`) for future use or evaluation on unseen scenarios.

This README.md file provides a clear and informative structure, explaining the project's purpose, setup instructions, and key concepts. It also encourages customization and references resources for further learning. While `eval_func.py` might be optional, it's acknowledged as a potential way to assess the trained model.
